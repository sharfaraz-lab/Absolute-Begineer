You are given with Principle amount($), Interest Rate(%) and Time (years) in that order. Find Simple Interest.

Print the output up to two decimal places (Round-off if necessary).

(S.I. = P*T*R/100)

Input Description:
Three values are given to you as the input. these values correspond to Principle amount, Interest Rate and Time in that particular order.

Output Description:
Find the Simple interest and print it up to two decimal places. Round off if required.

Sample Input :
1000 2 5
Sample Output :
100.00





my_string = str(input())
x = my_string.split()
P,T,R = x[0],x[1],x[2]
SI = (float(P)*float(T)*float(R))/100
print(round(SI,2))
